## Headphones are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears. They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound.

## Sometimes referred to as earphones, headphones are a hardware output device that either plug into a computer line out or speakers. Headphones allow you to listen to audio or watch a movie without disturbing people around you.
